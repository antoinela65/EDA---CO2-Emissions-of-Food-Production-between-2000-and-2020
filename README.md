# The Global Environmental Impact (CO2 Emissions) of Food Production Between 2000-2020

## Project Overview

As part of this programming project, I explored the impact of agricultural activities on CO2 emissions using a database detailing emissions attributed to various agriculture-related sources, as well as other environmental factors, for different countries and years. 

This database includes information on emissions due to savanna and forest fires, crop residues, rice cultivation, drained organic soils, pesticide manufacturing, and food transport, among other emission sources. 

Additionally, it provides demographic and climatic data such as rural and urban populations and temperature variations, offering a comprehensive overview to analyze the global environmental impact of food production.
